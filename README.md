Java Servlet Application with Session Management and Cookies


Description
This is a simple Java Servlet-based web application that demonstrates session management and cookie usage. It allows you to understand and implement user sessions and cookies in web applications. The application shows how to create and manage user sessions across multiple servlets and how to set and retrieve cookies.

Key features of this application include session management, cookie creation and handling, and the traversal of data between multiple servlets. It serves as a foundational example for building more complex web applications using Java Servlet technology.

Features
Java Servlet application structure with session management and cookie usage
Multiple servlets demonstrating data traversal
Setting and retrieving cookies in a web application
Customizable for adding more servlets and functionality


Usage
The application provides a practical demonstration of using Java Servlets to manage user sessions and cookies.
You can customize the application by adding your own servlets and enhancing its functionality as needed.
Ensure that your servlet container (e.g., Tomcat) is properly configured and running before deploying the application.
